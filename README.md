## About

I am a theoretical physicist with an in interest in machine learning. Currently, I am pursuing my PhD at Freie Universität, where I am working at the intersection of deep generative models and statistical mechanics.

I received my MSc and BSc in physics from Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, where I focused on first-principles electronic structure calculations (DFT, GW, BSE) in solids.
